# Deco-I-Need
The decoration E-commerce you were waiting for.

This is my first complete app with Farebase.

The app is an E-commerce. You can choose the product, create an account, log in and checkout. 
At the end you will recibe an order id and you can see all your purchases.

## Link to Gif Demostration
[You can see the demo from here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YtNhVXgvT-TQskWusa5ElPAN0xxrSzdB/view)<br />
In case you can not see the demostration in Google Docs, 
you can download the file and open it in a browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Bootstrap

I have used Bootstrap to facilitate the layout task.
